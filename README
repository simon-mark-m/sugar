Sugar is a macro system for the Tcl programming language, with a design
very similar to Lisp macros. Basically it provides a new way to create
Tcl procedures, using the [sugar::proc] command instead of the normal Tcl
[proc] command, and a way to define macros that are expanded inline
when the procedure is created.

For a quick API description check the API.txt file in this directory.

For some example, check the 'example' directory.
